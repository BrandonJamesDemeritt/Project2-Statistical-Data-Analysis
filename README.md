# Project2-Statistical-Data-Analysis
 Project 2 for C++

Was tasked to creat a Dynamic Array class using pointers.  The array could increase size as needed.

Two arrays would be created, one to store X values, one to store Y values.  Each value paired with the other in the same index number.

Was then tasked to find the following calculations(needed formulas were given):

1. Number (count) of x-y pairs stored in the input file
2. Average x-value and average y-value
3. Standard deviation of x-values and standard deviation of y-values
4. Correlation coefficient of x-values and y-values
5. Slope (m) and intercept (b) in the best fitting line, y = mx + b, of x-values and y-values.
